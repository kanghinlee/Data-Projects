GOAL/ Business Questions:
Our main business question is generally: How can we improve productivity within Scotland and the UK overall? 


3 MVPs are set up to answer our business questions:

Exploratory Analysis
• Which industries are lagging behind in terms of productivity and how could they catch up? 

Stat- Analysis
• What factors can be improved to increase employee and/or business productivity across UK regions? 

Extensions..
• Can we predict overall UK productivity rates?
- Time series forcast of UK's productivity rates

What is Productivity:
Productivity is commonly defined as a ratio between the output volume and the volume of inputs. 
It measures how efficiently production inputs, such as labour and capital, are being used in an economy to 
produce a given level of output.
